# Twelve Factor APP

The Twelve-Factor App methodology is a methodology for building software as a service applications. These best practices are designed to enable applications to be built with portability and resilience when deployed to the web.


## [CodeBase](https://12factor.net/codebase)
   
   One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
   
## [Dependencies](https://12factor.net/dependencies)

   Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
   
## [Config](https://12factor.net/config)

   Store config in the environment
   
## [Backing services](https://12factor.net/backing-services)

   Treat backing services as attached resources
   
## [Build,Release,Run](https://12factor.net/build-release-run)
   
   Strictly separate build and run stages
   
## [Process](https://12factor.net/processes)

   Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
   
## [Port Binding](https://12factor.net/port-binding)

   Export services via port binding
   
## [Concurrency](https://12factor.net/concurrency)

   Scale out via the process model

## [Disposability](https://12factor.net/disposability)

   Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

## [Dev/prod parity](https://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity)

   Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
   
## [Logs](https://12factor.net/logs)

   Treat logs as event streams
   
## [Admin Process](https://12factor.net/admin-processes)

   Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
