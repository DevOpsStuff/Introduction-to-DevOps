### DevOps
   
   DevOps (a clipped compound of "development" and "operations") is a software engineering culture and practice that aims at unifying software development (Dev) and software operation (Ops). The main characteristic of the DevOps movement is to strongly advocate automation and monitoring at all steps of software construction, from integration, testing, releasing to deployment and infrastructure management. DevOps aims at shorter development cycles, increased deployment frequency, and more dependable releases, in close alignment with business objectives. (source wiki)
   
  ##### My definition
  
   So, Basically DevOps is the gap between software devlopment and operations, It is set of practices that aim to apply the concept of manufaturing software devlopment., It is not a technology problem,but a business and cultural problem. And mainly the collabration and productivity between development and operations by automating infrastructure, Automating workflows, and continously measuring application performance.
